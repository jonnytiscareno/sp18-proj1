# Q0: Why is this error being thrown?
This is being thrown because there is no Pokemon model.

# Q1: How are the random Pokemon appearing? What is the common factor between all the possible Pokemon that appear? *
They are appearing because of the index.html.erb file in the views/home directory. They are all trainer-less.
# Question 2a: What does the following line do "<%= button_to "Throw a Pokeball!", capture_path(id: @pokemon), :class => "button medium", :method => :patch %>"? Be specific about what "capture_path(id: @pokemon)" is doing. If you're having trouble, look at the Help section in the README.
